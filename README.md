# Simple backend server for an api call for my React Client

This little server currently only serves one purpose. That is to parse the contents of one specific HTML page. The NYT Letterboxed page and return the current letters.

In future I may also use this backend to search for all possible 3 word solutions since it would take a browser a long time to do and use a lot of resources especially on a mobile device.
